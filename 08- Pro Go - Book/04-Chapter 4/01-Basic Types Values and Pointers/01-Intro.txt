What are they?
    * The data types are used to store the fundamental values common to all programming
        - numbers
        - strings
        - true/false
        - constant and variable values
        - Pointers are a special data type, which store a memory address.
    

Why are they useful?
    * basic data types are useful in their own right to store values
    * but they are also the foundation on which more complex data types can be defined
    * ther are not enough
    * Pointers are useful because 
        1-> they allow the programmer to decide whether a value should be copied 
        2-> when it is used.


How are they used?
    * The basic data types have their own names:
        - int
        - int32
        - int64
        - float32
        - float64
        - string
        - etc
        - Pointers created using the address operator -> &
        - can be used with the const and var keywords.
