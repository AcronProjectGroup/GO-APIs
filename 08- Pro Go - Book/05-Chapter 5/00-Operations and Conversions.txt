What are they?
    The basic operations are used for arithmetic, comparisons, and logical evaluation.

Why are they useful?
    it is difficult to write any code that doesn’t use them.

How are they used?
    The basic operations are applied using operands.

Are there any pitfalls or limitations?
    Any conversion process can be subject to a loss of precision and so care must be taken that converting a value doesn’t produce a result with less precision than the task requires.

Are there any alternatives?
    No. The features described in this chapter are fundamental to Go development.
