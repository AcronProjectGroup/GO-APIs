Introduction

Functions allow you to organize logic into repeatable procedures that can use different arguments each time they run. 
In the course of defining functions, 
youâ€™ll often find that multiple functions might operate on the same piece of data each time. 
Go recognizes this pattern and allows you to define special functions, called methods, 
whose purpose is to operate on instances of some specific type, called a receiver. 
Adding methods to types allows you to communicate not only what the data is, but also how that data should be used.
Defining a Method

The syntax for defining a method is similar to the syntax for defining a function. 
The only difference is the addition of an extra parameter after the func keyword 
for specifying the receiver of the method. 
The receiver is a declaration of the type that you wish to define the method on. 
The following example defines a method on a struct type:
