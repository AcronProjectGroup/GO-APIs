what is simple projects for Golang ?

There are several simple projects you can undertake to practice and learn Golang. Here are a few ideas:

Task Manager: 
    Create a command-line task manager that allows users to add, update, 
    and delete tasks. You can use Go's built-in file handling or a lightweight database like BoltDB.

URL Shortener: 
    Build a URL shortening service that takes long URLs as input 
    and generates shorter, more manageable URLs. 
    Users can then use the short URLs to access the original pages.

File Downloader: 
    Develop a file downloader that can retrieve files from a given URL 
    and save them locally. You can leverage the Go standard library's HTTP package for this project.

Weather App: 
    Create a command-line weather application that fetches weather data 
    from an API based on the user's location or a specified location. 
    You can use a popular weather API like OpenWeatherMap.

Markdown to HTML Converter: 
    Design a program that converts Markdown-formatted text to HTML. 
    You can utilize third-party packages like Blackfriday or Goldmark 
    to parse the Markdown syntax and generate the corresponding HTML output.

Image Resizer: 
    Build an image resizing tool that takes an input image file and resizes 
    it to a specified width and height. 
    You can use the Go Imaging library 
    (such as "github.com/disintegration/imaging") to handle image manipulation.

URL Scraper: 
    Develop a web scraper that extracts information from a given URL. 
    You can use the Go's net/http package to make HTTP requests 
    and third-party packages like Colly or GoQuery to parse HTML and extract relevant data.

Command-line Dictionary: 
    Create a command-line dictionary tool that allows users to search 
    for word definitions, synonyms, 
    antonyms, and example sentences. 
    You can utilize online dictionary APIs like WordsAPI or OwlBot.

These are just a few examples to get you started. 
You can tailor these projects based on your interests 
and gradually expand their functionality as you become more comfortable with Go. 
Remember to break down your projects into smaller tasks and focus on learning different aspects of the language along the way.
