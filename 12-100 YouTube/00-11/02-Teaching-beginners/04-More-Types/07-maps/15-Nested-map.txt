What Is Nested Map?

A nested map is simply a map of maps. 
This means that the key-value pairs of the outer map are another map.


Golang Create Nested Map

We can define a nested map the same way we declare a normal map. 
We start by setting the data type of the key (top-level map) and the type of the value. 
Since this is a nested map, the value of the top-level map is a map.

An example code is as shown below:

package main
func main() {
    nested := map[int]map[string]string{
        1: {
            "a": "Apple",
            "b": "Banana",
            "c": "Coconut",
        },
        2: {
            "a": "Tea",
            "b": "Coffee",
            "c": "Milk",
        },
        3: {
            "a": "Italian Food",
            "b": "Indian Food",
            "c": "Chinese Food",
        },
    }
}
