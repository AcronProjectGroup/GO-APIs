Etymology and symbols:
	Decimal comes from the Latin word “Decimus” which means “tenth”. 
	Whereas binary comes from the Latin “bini” which means “two together”. 
	
	The etymology of those two words give us a hint about how those systems are constructed :
	    # The binary system uses two symbols which are 0 and 1
	    # The decimal system uses ten symbols which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
