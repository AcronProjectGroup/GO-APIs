/*

The underscore is known as the blank identifier, 
and the result is a parameter for which a value must be
provided when the function is called but whose value 
cannot be accessed inside the functionâ€™s code block.
This may seem like an odd feature, 
but it can be a useful way to indicate that a parameter is not used within a
function, which can arise when implementing the methods required by an interface.
