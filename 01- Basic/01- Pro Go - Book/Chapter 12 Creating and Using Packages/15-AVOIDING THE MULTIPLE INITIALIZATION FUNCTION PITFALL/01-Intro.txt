Each code file can have its own initialization function. 
When using the standard Go compiler, 
the initialization functions are executed based 
on the alphabetic order of the filenames, 
so the function in the a.go file will be executed 
before the function in the b.go file, and so on.

But this order is not part of 
the Go language specification and should not be relied on. 
Your initialization functions should be self-contained 
and not rely on other init functions having been invoked previously.
