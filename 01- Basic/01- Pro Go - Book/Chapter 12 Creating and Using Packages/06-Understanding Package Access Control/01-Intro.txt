he Name and Category properties have an initial capital letter.
Go has an unusual approach to access control. 
Instead of relying on dedicated keywords, like public
and private, Go examines the first letter of the names given 
to the features in a code file, such as types,
functions, and methods. 
If the first letter is lowercase, 
then the feature can be used only within the package that defines it.

Features are exported for use outside of the package by giving them an uppercase first letter.

The names of the Name and 
Category fields also start with an uppercase letter, which means they are also exported.

The price field has a lowercase first letter, 
which means that it can be accessed only within the store package.

The compiler enforces the package export rules, which means that an error will be generated if the
price field is accessed outside of the store package
