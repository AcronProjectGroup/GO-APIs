Because Go doesn’t support classes, 
it doesn’t support class constructors either.


a common convention is to define 
a constructor function whose name is New<Type>, such as NewProduct
and that allows values to be provided for all fields, 
even those that have not been exported.



As with other code features, 
the capitalization of the first letter of the constructor function name 
determines whether it is exported outside of the package.
