/*

To implement an interface, 
all the methods specified by the interface must be defined for a struct type
like product.go file in 02- Tiny Project

Most languages require the use of a keyword 
to indicate when a type implements an interface, but Go
simply requires that all the methods specified by the interface are defined. 
Go allows different parameter
and result names to be used, 
but the methods must have the same name, 
parameter types, and result types.
