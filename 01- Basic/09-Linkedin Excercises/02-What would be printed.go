func Sizeof Â¶

func Sizeof(x ArbitraryType) uintptr

Sizeof takes an expression x of any type and returns the size in bytes of a hypothetical variable v as if v was declared via var v = x. 

The size does not include any memory possibly referenced by x. 

For instance, if x is a slice, Sizeof returns the size of the slice descriptor, 
not the size of the memory referenced by the slice. 

For a struct, the size includes any padding introduced by field alignment. 

The return value of Sizeof is a Go constant if the type of the argument x does not have variable size. 

(A type has variable size if it is a type parameter or if it is an array or struct type with elements of variable size).
