why use method in Golang give me reason with above code about Circle


In Go, methods are functions associated with a specific type. 
They provide a way to define behavior specific to that type 
and can be called using the dot notation on instances of the type.

In the given code example with the Circle struct, the use of methods offers several benefits:

Encapsulation: 
    By defining a method within the Circle struct, 
    you encapsulate the logic related to the Circle type within the type itself. 
    This promotes cleaner code organization and improves code maintainability.

Code Reusability: 
    Methods allow you to reuse the same logic across multiple instances of a type. 
    In this case, the calculateArea() method is defined for the Circle type, 
    enabling you to calculate the area of any Circle object with ease.

Intuitive Syntax: 
    By using a method, you can invoke the method directly on the Circle object, 
    making the code more readable and intuitive. 
    For example, with the circle.calculateArea() syntax, 
    it is clear that the calculateArea() method operates on the specific Circle instance circle.

Access to Struct Fields: 
    Methods have direct access to the fields of the struct they are defined on. 
    In the calculateArea() method, the radius field of the Circle struct 
    is accessible directly as c.radius. This simplifies the code and ensures proper encapsulation.

Using methods in this context improves the clarity, maintainability, 
and reusability of the code. 
It provides a logical way to associate behavior with a specific type and simplifies 
the usage of the associated functionality
