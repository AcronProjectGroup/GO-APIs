Description: In this video, we dive into the benefits of using slices over arrays in Go. 
We explore how slices are implemented as lightweight data structures that can save memory 
when dealing with large datasets, 
and how they offer other advantages such as dynamic resizing, 
easy manipulation of elements, and more. 
Through examples and explanations, 
we'll show you why slices are an essential tool in any Go developer's toolbox, 
and how they can make your code more efficient and flexible.
