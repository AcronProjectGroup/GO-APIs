/*

Each car normally costs $10,000 to produce individually, 
regardless of whether it is successful or not. 
But with a bit of planning, 
10 cars can be produced together for $95,000.

For example, 37 cars can be produced in the following way: 
37 = 3 x groups of ten + 7 individual cars

So the cost for 37 cars is: 3*95,000+7*10,000=355,000

Implement the function CalculateCost that calculates the cost of producing a number of cars, 
regardless of whether they are successful:

CalculateCost(37)
// => 355000

CalculateCost(21)
// => 200000

Note: the return value should be an uint.
