/*
In a previous example we saw how for and range provide 
iteration over basic data structures. We can also use 
this syntax to iterate over values received from a channel.

This range iterates over each element as itâ€™s received from queue. 
Because we closed the channel above, the iteration 
terminates after receiving the 2 elements.
