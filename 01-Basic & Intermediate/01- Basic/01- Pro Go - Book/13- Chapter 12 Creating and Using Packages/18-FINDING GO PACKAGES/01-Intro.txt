two useful resources for finding Go packages:
    https://pkg.go.dev
    https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Projects



The require statement notes the dependency on the github.com/fatih/color module and the other
modules it needs. The indirect comment at the end of the statements is added automatically because
the packages are not used by the code in the project. A file named go.sum is created when the module is
obtained and contains checksums used to validate the packages.




You can also use the go.mod file to 
create dependencies on projects you have created locally, which
is the approach I take in Part 3 for the SportsStore example.
