What is it?
    Go’s error handling allows exceptional conditions and failures to be represented
    and dealt with.

Why is it useful?
    Applications will often encounter unexpected situations, and the error handling
    features provide a way to respond to those situations when they arise.

How is it used?
    The error interface is used to define error conditions, which are typically returned
    as function results. The panic function is called when an unrecoverable error
    occurs.

Are there any pitfalls or limitations?
    Care must be taken to ensure that errors are communicated to the part of the
    application that can best decide how serious the situation is.

Are there any alternatives?
    You don’t have to use the error interface in your code, but it is employed
    throughout the Go standard library and is difficult to avoid.
