/* 

How are they used?
	Packages are defined by creating code files in folders and using the package
	keyword to denote which package they belong to.

Are there any pitfalls or limitations?
	There are only so many meaningful names, and conflicts between package
	names are common, requiring the use of aliases to avoid errors.

Are there any alternatives?
	Simple applications can be written without the need for packages.
