Putting String Processing and Regular Expressions in Context

What are they? 
    String processing includes a wide range of operations, from trimming whitespace to splitting a string into components. 
    Regular expressions are patterns that allow string matching rules to be concisely defined.
    پردازش رشته شامل طیف گسترده ای از عملیات،
    از برش فضای خالی تا تقسیم یک رشته به اجزا است. 
    عبارات منظم الگوهایی هستند که اجازه می دهند قوانین تطبیق رشته ها به طور مختصر تعریف شوند.


Why are they useful?
    These operations are useful when an application needs to process
    string values. A common example is processing HTTP requests.


How are they used?
    These features are contained in the strings and regexp packages,
    which are part of the standard library.

Are there any pitfalls or limitations?
    There are some quirks in the way that some of these operations are
    performed, but they mostly behave as you would expect.
