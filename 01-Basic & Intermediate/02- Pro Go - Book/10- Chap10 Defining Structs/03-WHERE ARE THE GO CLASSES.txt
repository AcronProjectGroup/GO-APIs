WHERE ARE THE GO CLASSES?

Go doesn’t differentiate between structs and classes, in the way that other languages do.

All custom data types are defined as structs, 
and the decision to pass them by reference or by value is made
depending on whether a pointer is used.

this achieves the same effect as having separate type categories 
but with the additional flexibility of allowing the choice to be made
every time a value is used.


It does, however, require more diligence from the programmer, who must
think through the consequences of that choice during coding.
با این حال، نیاز به دقت بیشتری از برنامه نویس دارد،
 که باید در طول کدنویسی به عواقب آن انتخاب فکر کند.

Neither approach is better, and the results are essentially the same.
